Using a .csv file to create methods to analyze the data in the file. 

**Source of the data:** I used my friend Kate's screentime log off of her iPhone, 
after gaining her permission to do so. I am allowed to use this data as she
gave me verbal permission.

**What does each row represent?** Each row/entry represents a day that Kate used
her phone. For example, one of the entries is July 1st, which is a day that 
Kate used her phpne.

**What if you needed to design a class?** I would need the following fields for each
object: date, total screen time, time of first use, screen on battery usage, most used app, 
pickups, and notifications. Therefore, I would need 7 fields for each object.
